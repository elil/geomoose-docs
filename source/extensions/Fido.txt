Fido Search - Quick and Dirty Client Side Searching Tool
========================================================

Abstract
--------

In previous versions of GeoMOOSE there was a DynamicZoom extension which would
allow the administrator to setup a PHP that would read a data source with lists
containing items that would have a label and an extent.  This would allow users
to choose areas from a wide range of different administrative defined types and
zoom to that area.

There were a few problems with this method:

	* These select lists can be rather long.  This makes them substantially
	  less useful for users.  There was no consistent internal support in
	* GeoMOOSE for generating those lists. That left the generation of the
	  script as an exercise to the installer. 

To address these shortcomings, Fido is a new extension and service that provides
the user with a partial-string matching quick-pick list.  That quick-pick list
is defined using similar GeoMOOSE semantics to other services.

Installing
----------

Edit ``site/includes.js`` and add::

	dojo.require('extensions.FidoSearch');

Configuring
-----------

1. Add ``fido-search="true"`` to the ``<map-source>``. From the demo mapbook::

	<map-source name="borders" ... fido-search="true">
		...
	</map-source>
	
2. In the mapfile ensure the following:
	a. All searchable layers have a PROJECTION element set.
	b. All searchable layers have a "fido_record" template.  basemap.map has an example of a. and b.
	c.  The "fido_record" template will look like this (example is for counties from the demo)::

		<!-- MapServer Template -->
		{"label" : "[COUNTYNAME] County", "extent" : [[shpext format="$minx,$miny,$maxx,$maxy" proj="epsg:4326"]]}
