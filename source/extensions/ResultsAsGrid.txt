ResultsAsGrid
=============

Adds the ability to see highlighted feature attributes in a Grid.

Pre-amble
---------

``ResultsAsGrid`` is actually a base class.  The intention is to create a class the inherits from it and allows customizations based on a local installation.


Create Your Own Grid Class
--------------------------

The demo contains an example of how to create a custom grid in ``extensions/ResultsAsGrid/DemoResultsAsGrid.js``.  This includes a demo of working with a subset of all selected features.  

To create a bare-minimum grid class, create a new file in the ``site/`` directory named ``MyGrid.js``.  This code will create and register a minimal MyGrid class::

	dojo.provide('site.MyGrid');

	dojo.require('extensions.ResultsAsGrid');

	dojo.declare('site.MyGrid', extension
	});

	GeoMOOSE.UX.register('site.MyGrid');



Adding Custom Tools
-------------------

This is where ``DemoResultsAsGrid`` really shines.  It contains an example of adding a toolbar, adding a button to that toolbar, and working with the data once that button has been clicked.
