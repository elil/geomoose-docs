Summary
-----------

This document describes the GeoMOOSE Project Mission.  The mission of GeoMOOSE is to provide a complete, easy to use web application, building on other OSGeo Projects where possible.

Details
-----------------------

* GeoMOOSE is a web mapping appplication that comes with a working demo that can be changed to work with your data.
* GeoMOOSE offers an optional but often desirable server side component (MS/PHP for printing, buffer, other functions) which constitute a complete application.
* GeoMOOSE is simple to install and flexible.
* GeoMOOSE is modular and configurable (configuration is done by an xml control file).
* GeoMOOSE is a framework including a rich, highly customiazable API and web services architecture upon which you can build.
* GeoMOOSE's primary users are GIS professionals, server administrators, or system implementers.  Most are not professional web programmers.  
* The GeoMOOSE project will use the website (http://geomoose.org) as a representation of the current status of the project including the mission, coding standards, documentation, FAQ, and other relevant information.
 
Observations (Why we need a Mission Statement)
-----------------------------------------------------

* Formally adopting a mission provides a good foundation from which to make GeoMOOSE project decisions.
* Goals and objectives can be used as guidance when deciding to change features and which changes require RFCs
* Stating clear goals and objectives makes them easily and widely accessible.
* Clear goals and objectives will make it easy for potential users and developers to decide if they want to participate.
* This also requires the existence of an FAQ that covers filing bugs, requesting enhancements, asking questions, contributing funding, other GeoMOOSE project operations, etc.
* This formalizes some things that are mostly already covered on the website or informally established.
