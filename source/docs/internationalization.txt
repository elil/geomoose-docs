Notes on Internationalization
=============================

Changing the Encoding
---------------------

Changing the input and output encodings in GeoMOOSE is done via the local settings.

In the ``conf`` directory open the ``local_settings.ini`` file and add the following lines to change GeoMOOSE to UTF8::

	[encodings]
	input-encoding=UTF-8
	output-encoding=UTF-8

Known Problems 
---------------

Currently, the GeoMOOSE test suite (found in ``/services/tests/query_php.py``), tests for various international characters in German, Portuguese, French, and Spanish. And while searching appears to work, as of the Mapserver 6.X series, templates are not returning the language encoded characaters.  For example searching for 'MÃ¤dchen' will return 'Mdchen'. When an appropriate work-around exists the tests will start to pass.
