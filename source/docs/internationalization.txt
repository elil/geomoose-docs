Changing the Encoding
---------------------

Changing the input and output encodings in GeoMOOSE is done via the local settings.

In the ``conf`` directory open the ``local_settings.ini`` file and add the following lines to change GeoMOOSE to UTF8::

	[encodings]
	input-encoding=UTF-8
	output-encoding=UTF-8
