Web Mapping in 15 Minutes with GeoMoose

What is it?
-------------
	* More of a customizable "application" you can tweak than a toolbox.
	* Have a look at http://www.geomoose.org/

What do I need?
-------------------
	* A Windows computer (Geomoose will work with others too)
	* Some Open Source Web Mapping packages:
		* GeoMoose (mostly JavaScript and PHP scripts, and includes OpenLayers)
		* MS4W (includes mapserver, and the Apache web server)

15 minutes to install? Go!
--------------------------------
	* :ref:`ms4w_install`
	* Ok, now that you've got your web mapping site with GeoMoose and the demo data, let's take a closer look.
